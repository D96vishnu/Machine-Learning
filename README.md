# Machine-Learning
My personal collection of projects I've worked on, in machine learning and deep learning.
(1) FeatureExtractionUsingDeepLearning is a classification method used on the stanford dog dataset from kaggle, using ResNet50, VGG16, Inception and Xception models.
(2) CuckooSearchLevy imports Benchmark_CFs.py , levyFlight.py, fitness.py, Params.py
(3) Regression demo is a stock prediction algorithm for google stock prices.
